## Hands-on Walkthrough

### Create a Blog

There are many things we can do with WordPress. For many people, the first thought would be a blog and this is a valid thought. WordPress can be used to create and present dynamic post-based information. Blog posts highlight information about an author, and they are arranged by their date of publication - displaying in reverse chronological order, but that can be changed as well. A blog is sorted by categories and tags so people can create special pages for their categories and readers can find posts based on tags they are following. Readers can also comment on posts so authors and administrators can establish a two-way dialog with readers.

### Create a Website

Another use for WordPress is to create a website. Unlike the dynamic flow of the blog, a website offers a static page-based presentation of information. Readers view one page at a time (rather than a list of posts), and they access different pages using a navigation menu. Website pages generally do not offer information on an author, a date of publication, or allow comments. People tend to use websites to generate real-world traffic, making sales and connections in person.

### Create an e-Commerce Website

WordPress can also be used to make sales. It allows for the purchasing of products online. Users can safely and securely process credit card, PayPal, and other payments through Payment Gateways. Site administrators can manage order fulfillment and use tools provided on WordPress to generate sales reports.

### Create a Website with a Blog

It is possible to combine the concepts of blog and website. This is done by making a front page (home page) static then linking to another page, which is set as a blog page. Combining the static page-based information and post-based information combines the best of both approaches.

### Create a Network of Websites

What about having multiple sites, all maintained and monitored by administrators, but set up so users can use their own logins? This is a great WordPress option for educators and businesses, and it can be done using the multisite options. Outside education and business, the multisite can be used for situations such as a pool league, in which each team gets their own site.

### Create a Social Network Website

With self-hosted WordPress sites, it's possible to create a social network site. One can do this using a plugin such as [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) or [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/). On WordPress.com sites, one can use the [P2 theme](https://wordpress.com/themes/p2) to create a forum and by using widgets such as the [talk.io widget](https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/tlk-io-widget/) or [Pidgin](https://en.support.wordpress.com/jabber/pidgin/) for chat.

### Create Apps

Turning a self-hosted WordPress site into an app is now possible using the [REST API plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/). This is handy for events and stores. It allows readers easy-access to a site from their portable devices.

### Monitor Who's Visiting Your Website

WordPress makes it simple to keep track of what is going on with your website. One could use the analytics built-in with [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) and a third-party such as [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/). It is also simple to integrate third party services via [plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=analytics).

### Generate More Web Traffic and Advertising Revenue

People often ask how to make money with their websites. There are various ways to do this with a WordPress site. One way is to use links with [Google AdWords](https://www.google.com/adwords/) and other advertising networks on a self-hosted site. WordPress.com offers [WordAds](https://wordads.co/), which is similar. These options allow a person to place ads on a site and receive compensation for views and clicks. Another income source is [affiliate links](https://en.support.wordpress.com/affiliate-links/). For this, someone signs up with an affiliate program, gets referral links, places them on a site then receives compensation when readers click the link and purchase a product.
